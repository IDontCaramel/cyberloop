# CyberLoop

## about
CyberLoop is a game i made alone for one of my exams. We had 4 days to complete it and i am very proud of the end result.

## Overview
In "CyberLoop", players step into the shoes of a skilled hacker in a sprawling futuristic city dominated by high-tech corporations. As a member of an underground resistance group, your mission is to hack into the city's security consoles to expose the corruption of the corporations while evading their security forces.
